In solo, melee the zipline panel with the electrified shield, then quickly use the zipline. When you're over the dock, melee to jump off the zipline. In co-op, one player must use the zipline, and the other must melee the control panel with the electrified shield as the other player is over the dock. In both solo and co-op, if the player melees at the wrong time, the player on the zipline will fall out of the map and instantly die and spectate. By using the zipline at the bottom instead of from Lab A, you can melee right away to more safely time the fall."
