If you successfully defend the flag, it will make a sound and can be picked up. After picking it back up, you must place it on one of the other electric spots and defend it again. There will now be large glowing symbols on the ground that must be avoided too. If you successfully defend it the second time, pick it up and deliver it to a Keeper ghost in one of the 4 ritual rooms. This must be done 4 times in total, one for each Keeper ghost and ritual room. Each time you deliver a flag to a Keeper ghost, the 2 spots you defended the flag at will no longer be there, and you must wait a round before the flag can be picked up again in the Subway Station.",
