Two yellow lights on top must be destroyed first, and will only be available to shoot at certain times. After that, you can destroy the two yellow lights on the front of the mech suit. During the fight, you will have to defend against R.A.P.S. in addition to the other enemies. Once the fight is done, all players will teleport back to Belinski Square, get the achievement, and can continue playing normally. Now that the dragon is dead, it will no longer light parts of the map on fire."
